TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:

To test your CPU, run "make cpu"
This will dump a logfile called 'TEST_LOG' in the current directory. To view the 
content, run "cat TEST_LOG". 

In the logfile you will see a chart where the columns are different circuit outputs,
and the rows are your circuit's outputs at the different clock cycles. If your output 
differs from the expected output, your output will appear with "***" in the front,
and the reference output will appear directly below with "REF" in the front. 

Logfiles are overwritten every time you run a test.

You can find the content of the tests in MIPS in the "tests/assem" folder
or in machine code in the "tests/hex" folder

To step through the tests manually, open the corresponding "CPU-..." file
once you've copied your latest version of your CPU into the "tests" folder.
